## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox
-   CSS Grid
-   Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

To remove the default arrow that appears next to the summary:

```css
summary {
    list-style: none;
}
summary::-webkit-details-marker {
    display: none;
}
```

To replace it with something else:

```css
details summary::before {
    content: "ðŸ¡’";
    color: red;
    /* you can style it however you want, use background-image for example */
}

/* By using [open] we can define different styles when the disclosure widget is open */
details[open] summary::before {
    content: "ðŸ¡‘";
    color: red;
}
```

### Continued development

Learn to animate the opening and closing of accordion (it doesn't work with CSS only, js needed).
